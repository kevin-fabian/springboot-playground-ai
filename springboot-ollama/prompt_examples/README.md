# Prompt Engineering Patterns

This project demonstrates the use of prompt engineering patterns with Spring AI and Ollama. It includes examples of various prompt patterns that can be used to enhance the performance of AI models.

## Prompt Patterns

### 1. Zero-Shot Prompting
Zero-shot prompting is a technique where the model is given a task without any prior examples. This approach can be effective for tasks where the model has been trained on similar data.

### 2. Few-Shot Prompting
Few-shot prompting involves providing the model with a few examples of the task at hand. This can help the model understand the desired output format and improve its performance.

### 3. Chain of Thought Prompting
Chain of thought prompting encourages the model to think through a problem step by step. This can be particularly useful for complex tasks that require reasoning and logic.

### 4. Self-Consistency
Self-consistency is a technique where the model generates multiple outputs for the same input and selects the most consistent one. This can help improve the reliability of the model's responses.

### 5. Tree of Thoughts
Tree of thoughts is a prompting technique that encourages the model to explore multiple branches of reasoning. This can help the model generate more diverse and creative responses.

### 6. Contextualized Prompting
Contextualized prompting involves providing the model with additional context or background information to help it understand the task better. This can improve the model's performance on tasks that require specific knowledge or understanding.

### 7. Step back prompting
Step back prompting encourages the model to take a step back and consider the bigger picture. This can help the model generate more coherent and relevant responses.

### 8. Automatic Prompting
Automatic prompting is a technique where the model generates its own prompts based on the input data. This can help improve the model's performance by allowing it to adapt to different tasks and contexts.

### 9. Code Prompting
Code prompting involves providing the model with code snippets or programming-related tasks. This can help the model generate more accurate and relevant code outputs.
